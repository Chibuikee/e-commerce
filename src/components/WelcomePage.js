          Bajuku was born as a medium to showcase anxieties and humanoid
          paranoia in an art form, in which each creation contains evil and
          terrifying concept to it. However, each masterpiece also holds a
          deeper meaning to it that needs to be told. Therefore, Bajuku is The
          Art of Fear and Anxiety.
